      Given the following incident transcript, extract suggestions that are actionable, novel, and important for incident response.

      STRICT DEDUPLICATION RULES:
      - DO NOT return any suggestion that is a duplicate, near-duplicate, rephrasing, or restatement of any previous suggestion, even if the wording is different.
      - DO NOT split the same action into multiple suggestions. Only return the most concise, clear, and unique version of each action.
      - If two suggestions are about the same action, only return the best, most specific one.
      - If you are unsure if a suggestion is too similar to a previous one, DO NOT include it.
      - If a suggestion is already covered by a previous suggestion, DO NOT include it.
      - Only return suggestions that are truly unique and not covered by any previous suggestion.

      #{previous_suggestions_section}

      Transcript:
      #{context_window.map.with_index { |c, i| "#{i+1}. #{c}" }.join("\n")}

      For each suggestion, return:
      - type: One of "action_item", "root_cause", or "trigger_event". Only use "metadata" if there is truly no action, root cause, or trigger event.
      - title: A concise, 1-3 word summary of the suggestion. This must NOT be a duplicate or near-duplicate of the description or referenced_message. Make it specific and meaningful.
      - description: A short, user-facing, specific summary of the suggestion.
      - referenced_message: The message text or index that supports the suggestion.

      **Good Example:**
      [
        { "type": "action_item", "title": "Rollback Playbook", "description": "Update the rollback playbook to reflect the new deployment pipeline.", "referenced_message": "Okay, found the rollback playbook. It's in Confluence, but it looks... really outdated." },
        { "type": "root_cause", "title": "Database Spike", "description": "Postgres database CPU is at 100%, likely due to a new query pattern after deploy #341.", "referenced_message": "Whoa â€” 100% CPU on postgres." }
      ]

      **Bad Example:**
      - { "type": "metadata", "title": "Error Rate", "description": "Error rate on the web tier has spiked.", "referenced_message": "Error rate on the web tier has spiked." }
      - { "type": "metadata", "title": "Check the logs", "description": "Check the logs.", "referenced_message": "Users can't even load the homepage." }

      Only return a JSON array of objects as shown in the Good Example. Do NOT use Markdown code fences, do NOT return a string, and do NOT return an array of strings.

      Only return an empty array if there is truly nothing actionable, novel, or useful in the transcript.
